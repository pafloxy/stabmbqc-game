The state under attack has the following : $\mathcal{S} = \{ X_{0}Z_{2} \: , \: X_{1}Z_{2} \: , \: Z_{0}Z_{1}X_{2}Z_{3} \: , \: X_{1}Z_{2}X_{3}Z_4\}$
generators. 

Charlie has been tasked to make the following measurements: $\{Y_{2}Z_{1}, X_{1}Z_{2}, Z_{4}, X_{3} \}$

But he can manage to discard one of the measurement. Help me choose that one
