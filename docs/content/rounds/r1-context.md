Alice holds $|\mathcal{S}, \psi\rangle$ with stabilizers $S_1 = \text{Z0 Z1}$ and $S_2 = \text{Z1 Z2}$ (3-qubit repetition code; sparse Pauli notation).

Bob uses only $\mathrm{CZ}$ gates to entangle. Charlie offers several Pauli measurements.

**Remember:** SAFE means anti-commutes with exactly one stabilizer.
