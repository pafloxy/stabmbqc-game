From last step we know : The two rotations $X_{4}Z_{3}(\theta_{1}) \:\text{and} \:X_{1}Z_{2}X_{3}(\theta_{2})$ do not commute.

Now the leading rotation $X_{1}Z_{2}X_{3}(\theta_{2})$ does not commute with $Z_{1}$ and $Z_{3}$ among the possible measurements Charlie can make. Let's see if we can make it commute with either of them using stabilizer-rewrite I told you about (see left panel pt.2). 

Select a possible rotation that can be obtained by rewriting $X_{1}Z_{2}X_{3}(\theta_{2})$ using elements in $\langle\mathcal{S}\rangle$ :
