The two rotations $X_{4}Z_{3}(\theta_{1}) \:\text{and} \:X_{1}Z_{2}X_{3}(\theta_{2})$ do not commute.

Also, the leading rotation $X_{1}Z_{2}X_{3}(\theta_{2})$ does not commute with $Z_{1}$ and $Z_{3}$ . Let's try if we can make it commute with either of them using stabilizer-rewrite I thought about. 

Select a possible rotation that can be obtained by rewriting $X_{1}Z_{2}X_{3}(\theta_{2})$ using elements in $\braket{\mathcal{S}}$ :
