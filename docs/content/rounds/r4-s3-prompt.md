Ok! So now the $X_{1}Z_{2}X_{3}(\theta_{2})$ is $X_{3}Z_{2}(\theta_{2})$ which commutes with $Z_{1}$ but still not with $Z_{3}$ . 

The commutation between the two rotations $X_{4}Z_{3}(\theta_{1})$  and $X_{3}Z_{2}(\theta_{2})$ are still the same. 

I don't know what to do now ... :/
but we can still ask Charlie to remove a measurement to save the logical state.

Which one should it be ?
