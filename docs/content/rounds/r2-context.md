Bob failed in the last attempt! But he's trying to more clever tricks ..

Same state as before 
$\mathcal{S} = \{ X_{0}Z_{2} \: , \: X_{1}Z_{2} \: , \: Z_{0}Z_{1}X_{2}Z_{3} \: , \: X_{1}Z_{2}X_{3}Z_4\}$

This time bob has added a pauli-rotation $X_{4}(\theta_{1})$ in his attack. 

Charlie has been tasked to make the following measurements: $\{X_{1}Z_{3}, X_{3} , Z_{0}Z_{3}\}$.
As before he can discard one of the measurement.
