Each round shows:

- Alice's current stabilizer generators (what she knows).
- A circuit sketch of Bob's CZ-attack + Charlie's measurement stage.
- A shortlist of candidate Pauli measurements Charlie might be forced to do.

Your job: pick which measurement Alice should *encourage* Charlie to perform.
