Our aim thus is to save the logical information encoded in the states from being ruined due to irreversible transformations due to measurements. 

A reversible logical transformation (a logical unitary) on the system is however fine, as long as we can figure out the transformations exactly, since we can revert it to get the state back. 

An example is as follows :

In the challenges that follow, we will encounter situations as follows. 

We will look into a state $\ket{\mathcal{S},\psi}$ under attack. 

Charlie will smuggle us :
1. Bob's attack circuit (made of sequence of $\mathrm{CZ}$ and $P(\theta)$) and 
2. Set of measurements that Bob had asked him too as set, often he can convince Bob to remove certain measurements or do a specific measurement, but not always (spy life .. .you know !)  

Our task would be based around mitigating the effect of measurements in
