# The UI

Here is how your console will look like

The panel on the left will display  
- Bob's attack circuit descrieas a figure 
- Alice's message about $\langle S \rangle$ and the measurements 

The panel on the right is where you answer to my questions. 

Buttons you'll have:

- Prev / Next: step through story slides.
- `Skip` : Move to next level

- `Rules` : opens the full story + mechanics reference.
- `Hints` : opens the short 'how to decide' checklist.
- `Restart Game`: resets everything back to the intro.
- Each round has a timer. If it hits zero: game over.
