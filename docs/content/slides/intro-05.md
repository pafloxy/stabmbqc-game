# The UI

Here is how your console will look like :

The panel on the left will display  
- Briegel's attack circuit shown as figure
	- Alaêm's qubit will be indexed as $\mathtt{A_i}$ and Briegel's as $\mathtt{B_{j}}$ 
	- Multi-pauli rotations will appear as boxes : $X_{4}(\theta) \: : \: \mathtt{X \textunderscore 4(th)}$
- Alaêm's message about $\langle S \rangle$ and the measurements 

The panel on the right is where you answer to my specific questions by clicking on the right option.

Buttons you'll have:

- Prev / Next: step through story slides.
- `Skip` : Move to next level

- `Rules` : opens the full story + mechanics reference.
- `Hints` : opens the short 'how to decide' checklist.
- `Restart Game`: resets everything back to the intro.
- Each round has a timer. If it hits zero: game over.
