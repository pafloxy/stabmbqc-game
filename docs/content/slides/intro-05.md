A candidate measurement $M$ is *safe* if it does NOT act like a logical measurement on $\ket{\psi}$.

Operational rule for the puzzle: a measurement that only 'updates the stabilizer record' is allowed; a measurement that reveals logical info is game-over.

During play, use the Hints panel for the quick checklist.
