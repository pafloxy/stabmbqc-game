 Welcome Professor (*upto HDR) Ollivier. Glad you accepted to help us!

Our ancient kingdom has stored its most precious secrets as quantum states. They are stored as logical information encoded into stabilizer codes.


A state as such can be represented as $|\mathcal{S},\psi\rangle$.

- $\langle \mathcal{S}  \rangle$ is the stabilzier group used for the encoding. 
- $\psi$ is the secret logical information that has been encoded. 

For any such state, only I know the stabilizer group $\langle \mathcal{S}  \rangle$ that were used for the encoding. However, noone knows the logical information that were actually encoded. 

But we know that we must protect the logical information from being destroyed since those secrets help your kingdom thrive.
