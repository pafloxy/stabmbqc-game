# The Invader and the Spy

However recently, Briegel has been trying to destroy those secrets. He has managed to gain access to the systems that store those quantum states and also developed certain techniques to carry out his plans. 

We have learnt from our spy, that he has the following capabilities:
- He can construct new $|+\rangle$ states. 
- He can perform $CZ$s between qubits on my systems 
- He can also perform pauli-evolutions, which are unitaries of the form $P(\theta) = \mathrm{exp}(-i \frac{\theta}{2} P)$ where $P$ is a multi-qubit pauli operator $P \in \mathcal{P}_{n}$.

He's main idea is to perform irreversible transformations on the encoded logical information, which he can induce via measurements on the system. 

But he lacks measurement capabilities, so he ask his ally Caséf. Caséf has the capability to perform multi-qubit projective measurements over pauli strings. 

Example: For a pauli $M \: \in \:\mathcal{P}_{n}$ a projective measurement $\hat{M}$ over state $\ket{\psi}$ yielding outcome $m$ ($m\in \{0,1\}$) leaves it in the 'post-measurement' state $\hat{M}(m) \: \ket{\psi}$ which is stabilized by $(-1)^{m}M$ i.e $(-1)^{m}M \: \hat{M}(m) \: \ket{\psi} \: = \:\hat{M}(m) \: \ket{\psi}$ 

However, Caséf is a spying for us but though
he wants to help us, but he cannot blow his cover by denying Briegel's instructions persistently.
