However recently, Bob has been trying to destroy those secrets. He has managed to gain access to the systems that store those quantum states and also developed certain techniques to carry out his plans. 

We have learnt from our spy, that he has the following capabilities:
- He can construct new $|+\rangle$ states. 
- He can perform $CZ$s between qubits on my systems 
- He can also perform pauli-evolutions, which are unitaries of the form $P(\theta) = \mathrm{exp}(-i \frac{\theta}{2} P)$ where $P$ is a multi-qubit pauli operator $P \in \mathcal{P}_{n}$.

He's main idea is to perform irreversible transformations on the encoded logical information, for which he will need to perform measurements on the system. 

However he lacks measurement capabilities, so he ask his friend asked Charlie to perform those measurements but actually he's a spy  working for us. 

Charlie has the capability to perform multi-qubit projective measurements over pauli strings. For a pauli $M \: \in \:\mathcal{P}_{n}$ a projective measurement $\hat{M}$ over state $\ket{\psi}$ yielding outcome $m$ ($m\in \{0,1\}$) leaves it in the 'post-measurement' state $\hat{M}(m) \: \ket{\psi}$ which is stabilized by $(-1)^{m}M$ i.e $(-1)^{m}M \: \hat{M}(m) \: \ket{\psi} \: = \:\hat{M}(m) \: \ket{\psi}$ 

He wants to help us, but he also cannot blow his cover by denying Bob's instructions persistently.
